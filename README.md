# Good Ice Cream [TERM PROJECT]
 TERM PROJECT FOR 15-112 ****
--------------------------------

// PROJECT DESCRIPTION //
   This project's name is Good Ice Cream. In this version, inspired by the game ‘Bad’ Ice Cream’ by Nitrome, the ice cream (player) is trying to save their kingdom which is being attacked by various goblins/enemies. To save their kingdom, they have to create a magical smoothie that will banish the goblins from the kingdom by collecting ingredients, the fruits. While doing so, they must avoid all enemies as some move in an already planned route while others directly chase you. This will take place within two levels where all fruits must be collected in order to pass. 

   Thus, the goal of the game is to collect all fruits needed in order to complete the current level. Depending on the level you’re on, the amount of fruits will vary. Some fruits also move around and you must catch up to them. In order to collect them, you must come into contact with them. 


   While doing this, you must avoid enemies/goblins; they will kill you if you come into contact with them. This project consists of two main enemies. One of them chases you directly and does not stop. The other has a path already determined and will follow that path unless it is blocked by ice. 


   As the player, you have a special ability that is creating and destroying ice. This is done by pressing space. This ice can be used to trap enemies or simply create guiding paths for enemies. At the boss battle, the player will also have the ability to shoot ice to lower the health of the boss. 


// HOW TO RUN GAME // ##   NEED TO DO THIS ONE!!!!!
    To run this game, you have to take the 'Good_Icecream_CodeBase' file out of the 'TP3' zip file. Then you should be good to run. Nothing else is needed afterwards.

//  LIBRARIES //
    You do not need any libraries to run this project

// SHORT CUT COMMANDS //
    Currently, the shortcut commands I have implemented for testing  are:
        'R' --> restarts level 1 when youre in level 1
        'Q' --> beats level 1, allows you to move onto level 2
    
    The following are controls for both levels:
        'A' --> move player sprite LEFT
        'W' --> move player sprite UP
        'S' --> move player sprite DOWN
        'D' --> move player sprite RIGHT
        'F' --> BLOW ICE
